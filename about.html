<p class="story">At Java Lava we're more than just a coffee company. We combine our commitment to social justice with a dedication to producing the finest coffees and food offerings through our franchises. We love the big wide world we live in and make helping its people a core aim of our business.</p>

<p class="story"> The waft of excellent hand-roasted coffee is surely one of the world’s greatest aromas, but to us, it represents more than just a job well done. It’s an opportunity to change the world we live in; to put people before profit; to give back to the community. Lava Java has been a finalist in the prestigious Roaster of the Year in 2014 and 2015. The business has grown since its inception seven years ago. Our franchises now offer great food to match our coffee.</p>

<p class="story"> A cup of coffee represents a chance to stop, think, relax and watch the world for a while. Sitting down with a group of friends and solving global problems over a quality cup of coffee (or three) is surely one of the world's favorite pastimes. So what if the act of purchasing and drinking coffee was solving major problems in itself? If you're buying from us... it is! Though a business, our key aim is to give a large portion of our profits to worthy causes. Which is why we give a percentage of the profit on each bag sold online.</p>

<p class="story"> That's not all; our wonderful franchisees also donate to local charities and causes in their region.</p>

<p class="story"> All you need is love...</p>

<p class="story"> You could say our story is one based on love; love of locally, hand-roasted coffee, love of people, and love of our community.</p>

<p class="story"> It began when owners Ali and Fletcher made the decision to adopt. They already had two beautiful kids, Isabel and Charlie, however, the call to adopt was strong for the pair and in 2009 Rob was on a flight to Ethiopia. Little was Rob to know that this event was to change not just his life and the lives of his two newly adopted children Tigist and Amelie, but also those of countless other people. For Rob had one of those inspirational ideas -- a true light bulb moment -- as he added up the expense of the adoption trip — and learned of the sacrifice and challenges of people in the same situation.</p>

<p class="story"> What if he were to set up a hand roasting business as a for-profit venture that existed to help others? One that took the customers into a form of social partnership? A simple idea but, like all great thoughts, one that was to have enormous power. In essence, Rob decided to start a business dedicated to using hand-roasted coffees to help others whose passion was to... well... just love.</p>
